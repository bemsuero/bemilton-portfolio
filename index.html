            <p>Welcome! I am a software developer. I am flexible with the languages that I need to use. I am currently comfortable using Ruby on Rails, and JS based languages such as Node and React.</p>

              <p>
                 Raised in Newark NJ, I have a true passion for creating solutions and solving problems (or riddles as I like to call them) through coding. I realized very young that I was not going to become a professional gamer. I made up for that by having an increasing interest in technology and its applications. I spend my free time solving problems either in code or through any of my hobbies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before delving into programming I was a middle school math and science teacher. This job allowed me to combine my passion for solving problems and my ability to help people. I believe that the best way to check my understanding of something is by teaching it to other people. If I can not explain it to a 7 year old, then I do not understand it.
